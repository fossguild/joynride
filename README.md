# joynride

Joynride is a community hitchhiking app.

**joynride is a project that aims to integrate a hitchhiking system into
different communities.**

Being developed for the Distributed Computing subject, with the guidance of
professor Francisco José Monaco and the participation of the students, joynride
aims to provide a platform where you can connect with members of your community,
such as university students, and provide a system for providing free rides
between members.

## About

The project, developed by engineering and computer science students from USP São
Carlos, aims to promote an application that allows providing or receiving free
rides between community members, facilitating mobility and encouraging drivers
to share routes that have already been planned, using micro-rewards as a way of
encouraging continuous use of the application.


## Goals and Motivation

Encouraging the integration of shared rides between community members makes it
easier to get around and promotes sustainable mobility. The app plans encourage
people who are already going to make the journey and have spaces available in
their cars to offer rides on a non-profit basis, but there may be incentives
within the community to encourage travel.

## How It Works

Within the app, the user can be a passenger, a driver or even both depending on
the context, offering or asking for a ride in exchange for micro-rewards in
order to stimulate shared rides between the community members. The app design
will be similar to relationship apps, in which will be possible to find
available rides to reach the most frequent destinations, also providing
departure points.

The passengers can apply for available rides according to their interests, which
will display the number of available car seats, times, and locations specified
by the driver. There will also be ratings of the driver, as well as comments on
behavior and driving skills to provide a better experience.

On the other hand, the drivers will be able to see all the users who applied for
the ride that they are offering, as well as the passenger's information,
ratings, and comments. Based on that, the driver will decide who to accept for
the ride.

It is also intended to allow communication between the driver and the hitchhiker
via messages, specifying or negotiating departure and arrival locations, to make
the journey better for everyone.
